\section{HEADINGS FORMAT}
\label{sec:headings}

The titles of the main sections have to be centered, numbered and in \textbf{12-point bold type} capital letters. With the exception of the abstract, nomenclature, references, and acknowledgements section headings have to be numbered. Blank lines need to be placed above and below each main section title.

\subsection{Sub-Section Headings}
Sub-sections headings have to be in lower case, \textbf{11-point bold} type letters. A blank line has to be placed above, but not below them.

\subsubsection{Sub-sub-section headings:} Sub-sub-sections should be avoided. If they are used, they should be justified left, in normal small letters, with the text beginning to the right.
